A3FJE9AUW0O41D	POLICY	New dress code policy	Hello all,</br></br></br></br>In going over the office policies, I notice that my predecessor implemented a fairly strict dress code, even though the majority of our workers never interact with customers. I've decided to relax the dress code requirements to make Initech a more enjoyable place to work. Employees who are interacting with clients will still be required to dress formally, but other employees will no longer be held to a formal dress code. They will still be held to the same standards as customers (e. g., you must wear a shirt) and to safety standards (e. g., if you are working with heavy equipment, you must wear safety gear). For full details, see the attached file. These changes are effective immediately.</br></br></br></br>Mike	office_mailing_list@initech-corp.com	new_dress_code.docx	mike@initech-corp.com
